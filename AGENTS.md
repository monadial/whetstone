## CodeGraph

In repositories indexed by CodeGraph (a `.codegraph/` directory exists at the repo root), reach for it BEFORE grep/find or reading files when you need to understand or locate code:

- **MCP tool** (when available): `codegraph_explore` answers most code questions in one call — the relevant symbols' verbatim source plus the call paths between them, including dynamic-dispatch hops grep can't follow. Name a file or symbol in the query to read its current line-numbered source. If it's listed but deferred, load it by name via tool search.
- **Shell** (always works): `codegraph explore "<symbol names or question>"` prints the same output.

If there is no `.codegraph/` directory, skip CodeGraph entirely — indexing is the user's decision.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Track issues and specs in GitHub Issues for `monadial/whetstone`. Before reading or publishing tickets, read `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Use the five default triage labels. Before triaging or applying a triage label, read `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Use a single-context layout: root `GLOSSARY.md` and `docs/adr/`. Before exploring the codebase, read `docs/agents/domain.md`.
